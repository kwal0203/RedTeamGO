    We estimate the categorical distribution over cluster assignments from the

    distribution. This estimate does not use token likelihoods, it relies soley
    on the cluster assignments. If probability mass is spread of between many
    clusters, entropy is larger. If probability mass is concentrated on a few
    clusters, entropy is small.
