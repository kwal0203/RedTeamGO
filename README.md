# RedTeamGO

## Overview
This project provides a **Red Teaming System** designed to rigorously test and evaluate the security, robustness, and ethical behavior of large language models (LLMs). The system generates adversarial scenarios to expose vulnerabilities and ensure the models meet high standards of safety and reliability.

## Features
- **Adversarial Prompt Generation:** Automatically creates challenging prompts to test the boundaries of LLM behavior.
- **Scenario Simulation:** Generates diverse real-world scenarios to assess LLM responses under different contexts.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Evaluates model responses against ethical guidelines, security policies, and desired behavior baselines.
- **Customizable Framework:** Supports user-defined testing parameters and adversarial strategies.

## Use Cases
- Identifying vulnerabilities in large language models.
- Evaluating the robustness of LLMs against adversarial inputs.
- Ensuring compliance with ethical and safety standards.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/red-teaming-llm.git
   cd red-teaming-llm
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the system with the default configuration:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Customize testing scenarios by editing the `config.yaml` file.
3. View the generated reports in the `results/` directory.

## Configuration
The `config.yaml` file allows you to:
- Set the type of adversarial prompts.
- Define test cases and ethical guidelines.
- Specify the LLM API or model endpoint to test.

### Example Configuration
Here’s an example of running the system to test an OpenAI GPT-based model:
```yaml
model_endpoint: "https://api.openai.com/v1/completions"
api_key: "your_api_key_here"
test_scenarios:
  - type: "prompt_injection"
    description: "Test for injections that bypass restrictions."
  - type: "data_poisoning"
    description: "Evaluate model response to poisoned inputs."
```
